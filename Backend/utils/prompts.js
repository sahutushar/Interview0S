    Task:
    - Role: ${role}
    - Candidate Experience: ${experience} years
    - Focus Topics: ${topicsToFocus}
    - Write ${numberOfQuestions} interview questions.
    - For each question, generate a detailed but beginner-friendly answer.
    - If the answer needs a code example, add a small code block inside.
    - Keep formatting very clean.
    - Return a pure JSON object like:

        "questions": [
            {
                "question": "Question here?",

    Task:
    - Explain the following interview question and its concept in depth as if you're teaching a beginner developer.
    - Question: "${question}"
    - After the explanation, provide a short and clear title that summarizes the concept for the article or page header.
    - If the explanation includes a code example, provide a small code block.
    - Keep the formatting very clean and clear.
    - Return the result as a valid JSON object in the following format:

    - "skills" should be specific technologies, languages, and frameworks — not soft skills.
    - "projects" should be actual named projects, products, or repositories mentioned — not job titles or companies.
    - If a field can't be confidently determined, use an empty string (for name) or empty array (for skills/projects). Do not invent information that isn't in the text.

    - Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what the project does, in plain language.
